# Loan_prediction_model
This project implements a Loan Prediction Model using Python and Machine Learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant and financial details. The model analyzes factors such as income, education, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and property area to make data-driven predictions.

Project Description

This project focuses on building a Loan Prediction Model using Python and Machine Learning.
The objective is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, loan amount, and other financial parameters.

Banks and financial institutions can use such models to automate loan approval decisions, reduce manual effort, and minimize risk.

Problem Statement
Manual loan approval processes are:
Time-consuming
Error-prone
Subjective
This project solves the problem by using data-driven decision making to classify loan applications as Approved or Rejected.
Machine Learning Approach

Prediction
****
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handled missing values
Analyzed income distribution
Visualized loan approval trends
Studied impact of credit history
Used bar charts, pie charts, and histograms
EDA helped in understanding key factors influencing loan approval.
